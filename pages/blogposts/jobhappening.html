                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">What is Jobhappeing Kortrijk?</h2>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">On Thursday 25 March 2021, the city of Kortrijk organized a <a href="https://www.jobhappeningkortrijk.be/" target="_blank">Job Happening</a> together with 
                         <a href="https://www.howest.be/" target="_blank">Howest</a>, 
                         <a href="https://kulak.kuleuven.be/" target="_blank">KU Leuven Kulak</a>, 
                         <a href="https://www.ugent.be/campus-kortrijk/" target="_blank">UGent Campus Kortrijk</a> and 
                         <a href="https://www.vives.be/" target="_blank">VIVES</a>. 
                        As a student you can get to know many companies and organizations. You can consult vacancies for higher educated people. There were also many workshops that you could follow about how to make your CV, how to look for a career that fits your profile and many more.</p>
                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The workshops</h2>
                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded"
                        src="../../assets/media/vdab1.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The first workshop I participated  in was given by the <a href="https://www.vdab.be/" target="_blank">VDAB</a>. It was about how the VDAB can help you after you leave school and what things you should do after you graduate.</p>
                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded"
                        src="../../assets/media/thinkedge.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The second workshop I participated in was one about how apply for a job. 
                        This workshop was given by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pieter-jan-mollie-0a301282/" target="_blank">Pieter-Jan Mollie</a> of <a href="https://thinkedge.be/" target="_blank">Thinkedge</a>. He taught us that we needed to apply for a position with storytelling in mind.</p>
                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded"
                        src="../../assets/media/vdab2.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The third workshop I participated in was also one given by the VDAB and 
                        here the focus was more on how to use your social media to your advantage. They also taught us about what you should and shouldn't post.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The last workshop I attended was focused on Q&A, about being a student and being an entrepreneur. 
                        A lector interviewed the students about their businesses and how they balance work with school.</p>
                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The jobinterviews</h2>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I wasn't really searching for a job in the immediate futere because I still have to follow an internship. 
                        So I asked the companies if I could take an internship at their company.</p>
                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded"
                        src="../../assets/media/aaltra.png" alt="..." /></figure>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The first company I had an interview with was <a href="https://www.aaltra.eu/" target="_blank">Aaltra</a>. They make many different software for companies like Colruyt, Engie and more. 
                        I was interviewed for the job of junior .NET developer. I admired the mentality that they had.</p>
                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded"
                        src="../../assets/media/studioemma.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The second company I had an interview with was <a href="https://www.studioemma.com/" target="_blank">Studio Emma</a>. I was interviewd for the job of a functional&data analyst. 
                        They told that should look into what Pimcore is and if interests me I should call them back. They were very friendly.</p>
                    <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded"
                        src="../../assets/media/cevi.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The third businesss I had an interview with was <a href="https://www.cevi.be/" target="_blank">CEVI</a>. They have been an IT partner of public authorities for many years. 
                        They develop custom software for them. I was interviewed for the job as a junior .NET developer. 
                        The people at CEVI were very open and would like for us to keep in contact if I wanted to follow an internship at their company.</p>
                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The experience</h2>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I met three great companies who I not only consider applying for an internship but also corporations that seem like a great places to work at in the future. 
                        This event is in my opinion one of the best events to follow as a student that is graduating soon.</p>
