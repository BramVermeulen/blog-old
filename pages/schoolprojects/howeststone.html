                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">What is HowestStone?</h2>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This was the first big school project I made during my bachelor in applied computer science.
                         For this project we made a variant of the game Hearthstone that is made by Blizzard called HowestStone. 
                         This was the first time that we had to use our newly acquired skills and knowledge that we had learned in other courses in combination with one another.
                         Because it was such a big project we learned a lot along the way.</p>
                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Learning by trial-and-error</h2>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Some things did not go as planned. For example we focused to much on making the game visually appealing, while the game was not yet fully functional. 
                        This cost us a lot of time we should have allocated to functionality of the game. 
                        We also noticed during the project how important it was to ask questions if we were not certain about how we should make something.</p>
                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The team</h2>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This project was a group project which I worked together on with three colleagues:

                        The brother of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bert-van-mulders-a48b31193/" target="_blank">Bert Van Mulders</a>,
